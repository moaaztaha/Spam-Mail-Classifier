- on test set

### spam - hard_ham

- After trying several models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) **Settled on Random Forest as it was the one was highest *recall score on the testset*** **98.98%** with **good Precision score 94.06%**

### All Ham + Spam 

- This made the data badly skewed as there were more ham emails than spam emails (2750 to 500)

  - it's more clearer on the test set as the recall is very bad

- Stratifying the data didn't help as the spam emails are too little
